The main difference between bcrypt.hash() and bcrypt.hashSync() is that bcrypt.hash() is asynchronous, while bcrypt.hashSync() is synchronous. This means that bcrypt.hash() will return a Promise, which can be used to handle the result of the hash operation when it is complete. bcrypt.hashSync(), on the other hand, will block the event loop until the hash operation is complete and return the hashed value.
